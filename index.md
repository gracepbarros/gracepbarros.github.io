    title: Welcome
    text: Hello, my name is Grace and I will graduate in Computer Studies at Langara College in 2024.
    Here it goes how I fell in love with programming... It was back in 2017 while I was living in Brazil and starting my first graduation at Mechanical Engeneering. Python was my first contact with coding, with which I not only developed my first projects but also decided to be a Teacher Assistant to starting teaching what I loved most.
    After that I realize I didn't want to finish that Engeneering degree, instead I would be accomplished pursuing and IT graduation. After a few adjustments on my personal life (and a mundial pandemic from corona virus) I moved to Vancouver, BC - Canada and started to study what I really loved. At each step of this process I'm eager for knowledge and experience, and each day more I love to do that.
    Soon I will be an expert, but for now I need a first opportunity as a co-op / intership to start my career. Afterall, there is no study I can do to become a Senior, only experience and effort will bring me that.
    Furthermore, count on me be the most proactive, communicative and dedicate person you know. I don't accept less than my best in every activity I do.
    Take a look at my <a href="https://github.com/gracepbarros"> github</a> and see some of my repos of what I've learned so far.
